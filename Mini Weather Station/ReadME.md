This program is made with the Arduino Sensor kit, but can be made without if you have the components laying around!
The program uses a Temperature and Humidity sensor and light sensor. 

# **What do you need?**
You will need a few things:
- Arduino Uno
- Sensor Kit
- Baseplate (comes with the senor kit)

##### **ATTENTION** If You dont have the sensor kit you will need the following:
- LED
- Button
- Light Sensor
- Temperature and Humidity sensor
- 0.96" OLED display (if you have a bigger OLED display you may use that also, might have to tweak around with the display settings)
